<h1 id="piggame">PigGame</h1>

<p>A legacy PigGame with a touch of (React) class</p>

<p>This started off as a simple JavaScript exercise (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/), but when it came time to add an input field to change
the game’s winning score, I used a React component. This was a useful exercise for me: adding React required
hooking into the original code and can be used as a template of sorts for other such tasks. This was
accomplished with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the new input form with the React Component “GetWinningScoreForm”.</li>
  <li>Define a new PigGame method “setWinningScore” as the callback (hook) function. React uses this function to pass
the updated winningScore value back to PigGame.</li>
  <li>Call the setWinningScore method from the input form’s submit method.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="game-rules">Game Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds or turns</li>
  <li>In each turn, a player rolls a di as many times as they wish. Each dice roll value gets added to their ROUND score</li>
  <li>BUT, if the player rolls a 1, their turn is over and their ROUND score is lost. After that, it’s the next player’s turn</li>
  <li>AND, if a player rolls two sixes in a row, they lose the game</li>
  <li>The player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLBAL score. After that, it’s the next player’s turn</li>
  <li>Game starts at 100 points to win the game;</li>
  <li>Players can change the points required to win the game</li>
  <li>The first player to reach the winningScore points on GLOBAL score wins the game</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Roll two die; players loses their turn if any one of them is a 1</li>
  <li>Determine why we get this error “Uncaught TypeError: self.postMessage is not a function” at startup</li>
  <li>Consider breaking out the “currentWinningScore” code into a separate component.</li>
</ul>
